            <h1>Who are Guns N&#39; Roses&#63;</h1>
            <p class="text1">Guns N' Roses were formed in Los Angeles in 1985, when a group of kids who played in two local rock bands decided to join their luck. Izzy Stradlin and Axl Rose came from a group called the Hollywood Rose, while Tracii Guns, Rob Gardner and Ole Beich came from the band LA Guns. When both bands merged, they adopted the joint name of Guns N' Roses.
            After a first introductory show, Beich was fired and replaced by Duff McKagan. While they were planning the songs that would make up their first recording, an argument between Axl Rose and Tracii Guns led him to leave the band. His place was taken by a former Hollywood Rose guitarist who had previously worked with Axl, Slash.
            One last change had to take place in the group before embarking on the recordings. Rob Gardner, the last remaining member of Guns, also decided to jump that ship, being replaced on drums by Steven Adler, who also hailed from Hollywood Rose.
            With this composition, the first Guns N'Roses album appeared on the market in 1987. The songs from the Guns N'Roses album 'Appetite for Destruction' achieved immediate success worldwide, with singles like "Welcome to the Jungle ", "Sweet Child o' Mine", "Paradise City" or "Nighttrain". The album manages to rise to the highest positions in the American charts.
            Parallel to these successes, his public appearances were quite lurid. As soon as they destroyed the hotel rooms in the cities where they performed, they started fights or canceled concerts due to drug problems. At a concert in England, two fans died when they were crushed by the crowd as the Guns came out on stage.
            In 1988 Guns N'Roses publish 'GN'R Lies'. In 1989 they performed at the MTV awards ceremony and began a tour with the Rolling Stones.
            In 1990 Adler left the group due to his drug addiction, and was replaced by Matt Sorum. They create the soundtrack of the movie 'Days of Thunder', by Tom Cruise, with the version of an old song by Bob Dylan.
            After hard work, Guns N'Roses recorded the songs for their album 'Use Your Illusion I' and 'Use Your Illusion II', both released simultaneously in 1991.
            This enormous work forces them to carry out a gigantic tour with tremendous success among their fans. They perform at the Rock en Rio festival, at the Maracana stadium and collaborate on the soundtrack of 'Terminator 2'. That same year (1991) Izzy Stradlin left the group due to exhaustion from touring and disagreements with Axl.
            In 2008 Guns N' Roses publish "Chinese Democracy", the first album with original songs after the simultaneous releases of "Use Your Illusion I" and "Use Your Illusion II" in 1991, and it is the first studio album after the release in 1993's "The Spaghetti Incident?".
